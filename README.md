# Emoji-App

Emoji-App is an android application which was built to study new technologies. 

## What technologies did I use?

- Kotlin
- From Koin to Dagger Hilt (see commits)
- JUnit (I gave myself one week to build a great application. Some tests are still remaning)
- Mockito (See above)
- Room
- Clean Architecture
- Flow
- MVVM
- Jetpack (LiveData, etc)
- Good practices for programming

PS.: As I said above, some tests are still remaining. I'd like to keep writing unit tests and instrumented tests. For now, that's it.

Thank you so much!
